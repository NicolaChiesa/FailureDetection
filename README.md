# Failure Detection Project

## Overview

This repository contains the code for my project developed during the Machine Learning Course at the University of Genoa. The project focuses on failure detection in machines based on their parameters. It was inspired by the Binary Classification of Machine Failures competition on Kaggle (Competition Link), where I achieved an accuracy of 97%.

## Project Description

The objective of this project is to predict machine failures given their parameters in a given instance. To achieve this, I employed various machine learning techniques, including Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting.

## Techniques Used

In addition to the aforementioned algorithms, I implemented techniques such as subsampling and oversampling to address the imbalance in the dataset. These approaches helped improve the model's performance and reliability.

## Repository Structure

- MyMachineFailurePredictions.ipynb : Contains the Python scripts used for data preprocessing, model training, balancing and evaluation.
- Data : Includes the dataset used for training and testing the models.
- MachineFailurePrediction.pptx : i provide a PPT that explain the process and show the result obtained 


## Future work 
Feel free to explore the code and provide any suggestions or feedback. Contributions are welcome!
